 # ðŸ“œ Phantom Sharer Manifesto

Sharing is not a crime. It is a digital human right.

We live in an era where every click is monitored, every file logged, and every digital action deemed suspicious.  
Phantom Sharer was born as a response to this surveilled world, where privacy has become an act of rebellion.

We believe that:

- Knowledge must flow freely.  
- Surveillance should not be the price of using technology.  
- No one should fear sharing.

We are not anonymous because we have something to hide â€” but because we want to be free.

**Phantom Sharer will not be a product. It will be a refuge.**  
A node among many. A ghost among ghosts.

Always free.
